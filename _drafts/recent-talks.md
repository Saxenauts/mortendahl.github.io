In the past few months I've been fortunate enough to have several occasions to present some of the work done at [Snips](https://snips.ai) on applying [privacy-enhancing technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhancing_technologies) to concrete problems encountered while building privacy-aware machine learning systems. 

Most of theme have centered around our [*Secure Distributed Aggregator*](https://github.com/snipsco/sda) for privately learning from user data distributed on mobile devices, i.e. without learning anything except the final aggregation, but there has also been room for discussions about privacy at a higher level, including how it has played into the business of the company.

# Private Multi-Party Machine Learning '16


concrete protocol for application of secure computation to federated learning 

[*Private Multi-Party Machine Learning 2016 (PMPML'16)*](https://pmpml.github.io/PMPML16/), a [*NIPS'16*](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016) associated workshop.


# Theory and Practice of Multi-Party Computation '17

- present concrete application of MPC to primarily academic
- propose practical considerations taken in implementation, such as packed secret sharing and packed Paillier
- highlight difficulty of independent parties to employ MPC due to the need of other parties to split trust with; proposed `community MPC` as a potential model for further protocols

This talk, given at workshop on [*Theory and Practice of Multi-Party Computation 2017 (TPMPC'17)*](http://www.multipartycomputation.com/tpmpc-2017)


# Privacy in Statistical Analysis '17

- overview of the implications privacy has had on Snips
- concrete experiments and applications of PETs
- privacy from a business perspective

[*Privacy in Statistical Analysis 2017 (PSA'17)*](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nadams/events/ic-rss2017/ic-rss2017.html)
