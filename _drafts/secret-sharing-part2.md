<em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> efficient secret sharing requires fast polynomial evaluation and interpolation; here we show what it takes to use the Fast Fourier Transform for this.</em>

In the [first part](/2017/06/04/secret-sharing-part1/) on secret sharing we looked at Shamir's scheme and its packed variant where several secrets are shared together. Polynomials lie at the core of both schemes

do we use the values of a polynomial 

There is a Python notebook containing [the code samples](https://github.com/mortendahl/privateml/blob/master/secret-sharing/Fast%20Fourier%20Transform.ipynb), yet for better performance our [open source Rust library](https://crates.io/crates/threshold-secret-sharing) is recommended.

Parts of this blog post are derived from work done at [Snips](https://snips.ai/) and [originally appearing in another blog post](https://medium.com/snips-ai/high-volume-secret-sharing-2e7dc5b41e9a). That work also included parts of the Rust implementation.

**TODO TODO TODO motivation for using a prime field (as opposed to an extension field): it allows us to naturally use modular arithmetic to simulate bounded integer arithmetic, as useful for instance in secure computation. in the previous post we used prime fields, but all the algorithms there would carry directly over to an extension field (they will here as well, but again we focus on prime fields). binary extension fields would make the computations more efficient but are less suitable since it is less obvious which encoding/embedding to use in order to simulate integer arithmetic**


# Polynomials

First a polynomial is sampled and then its values at certain points are taken as shares; but notice that different methods are used for taking these values, we'll come back to this below. 


If we [look back](/2017/06/04/secret-sharing-part1/) at Shamir's scheme we see that it's all about polynomials: a random polynomial embedding the secret is sampled, and the shares are taken as its value at certain points.

```python
def shamir_share(secret):
    polynomial = sample_shamir_polynomial(secret)
    shares = [ evaluate_at_point(polynomial, p) for p in SHARE_POINTS ]
    return shares
```

The same goes for the packed variant, where several secrets are embedded in the sampled polynomial.


```python
def packed_share(secrets):
    polynomial = sample_packed_polynomial(secrets)
    shares = [ interpolate_at_point(polynomial, p) for p in SHARE_POINTS ]
    return shares
```

Notice however that it differs in how the values of the polynomial are found: Shamir's scheme uses `evaluate_at_point` while the packed uses `interpolate_at_point`. The reason is that the sampled polynomial in the former case is in *coefficient representation* while in the latter it is in *point-value representation*.

Specifically, we often represent a polynomial `f` of degree `N` by a list of `N+1` coefficients `a0, ..., aN` such that `f(X) = (a0) + (a1 * X) + (a2 * X**2) + ... + (aN * X**N)`. This representation is convenient for many things, including efficiently finding the value of the polynomial at a given point using e.g. [Horner's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method).

However, every such polynomial may also be represented by a set of `N+1` point-value pairs `(p0, v0), ..., (pN, vN)` where `vi = f(pi)` and all the `pi` are distinct. This requires a more involved procedure for finding the value at 

secrets are somehow embedded in a polynomial that is then evaluated at a set of points to obtain the shares. More specifically, both schemes have perform the following two steps:
1. sample polynomial `f` satisfying a set of constraints
2. evaluate `f` at a set of points




But  The reason for this is that the representation of the sampled polynomial is different: in the first case it is in coefficient form while in the latter it is in point-value form.











# Secret Sharing

The core of sharing in both schemes is


while the core of reconstruction is interpolation. As we shall see below, in both cases it is hence essentially about converting from one representation of polynomials to another.


# Performance Improvements

The algorithms below are somewhat more complex than those of the previous post and as we shall see, adds some constraints on how we can choose our privacy threshold `T` and number of shares `N`.

Jumping ahead, here are a comparison between the performance of the implementations in the first post to those of this post....

FFT is worth it


# Fast Fourier Transform

Indeed, our current implementation of the packed scheme relies on the Fast Fourier Transform over finite fields (also known as a Number Theoretic Transform), whereas the typical implementation of Shamirâ€™s scheme only needs a simple evaluation of polynomials.

```python
# len(aX) must be a power of 2
def fft2_forward(aX, omega=OMEGA2):
    if len(aX) == 1:
        return aX

    # split A(x) into B(x) and C(x) -- A(x) = B(x^2) + x C(x^2) -- and recurse
    bX = aX[0::2]
    cX = aX[1::2]
    B = fft2_forward(bX, (omega**2) % Q)
    C = fft2_forward(cX, (omega**2) % Q)
        
    # combine subresults
    A = [0] * len(aX)
    Nhalf = len(aX) // 2
    for i in range(Nhalf):
        x = (omega**i * C[i]) % Q
        A[i]         = (B[i] + x) % Q
        A[i + Nhalf] = (B[i] - x) % Q
    return A

def fft2_backward(A):
    N_inv = inverse(len(A))
    return [ (a * N_inv) % Q for a in fft2_forward(A, inverse(OMEGA2)) ]
```

```python
# len(aX) must be a power of 3
def fft3_forward(aX, omega=OMEGA3):
    if len(aX) == 1:
        return aX

    # split A(x) into B(x), C(x), and D(x): A(x) = B(x^3) + x C(x^3) + x^2 D(x^3)
    bX = aX[0::3]
    cX = aX[1::3]
    dX = aX[2::3]
    
    # apply recursively
    omega_cubed = (omega**3) % Q
    B = fft3_forward(bX, omega_cubed)
    C = fft3_forward(cX, omega_cubed)
    D = fft3_forward(dX, omega_cubed)
        
    # combine subresults
    A = [0] * len(aX)
    Nthird = len(aX) // 3
    for i in range(Nthird):
        
        j = i
        x = (omega**j) % Q
        xx = (x * x) % Q
        A[j] = (B[i] + x * C[i] + xx * D[i]) % Q
        
        j = i + Nthird
        x = (omega**j) % Q
        xx = (x * x) % Q
        A[j] = (B[i] + x * C[i] + xx * D[i]) % Q
        
        j = i + Nthird + Nthird
        x = (omega**j) % Q
        xx = (x * x) % Q
        A[j] = (B[i] + x * C[i] + xx * D[i]) % Q

    return A

def fft3_backward(A):
    N_inv = inverse(len(A))
    return [ (a * N_inv) % Q for a in fft3_forward(A, inverse(OMEGA3)) ]
```

# Application to Secret Sharing

## Shamir's scheme

```python
def shamir_share(secret):
    small_coeffs = [secret] + [random.randrange(Q) for _ in range(T)]
    large_coeffs = small_coeffs + [0] * (ORDER3 - len(small_coeffs))
    large_values = fft3_forward(large_coeffs)
    shares = large_values
    return shares
```


## Packed scheme

```python
def packed_share(secrets):
    small_values = [0] + secrets + [random.randrange(Q) for _ in range(T)]
    small_coeffs = fft2_backward(small_values)
    large_coeffs = small_coeffs + [0] * (ORDER3 - ORDER2)
    large_values = fft3_forward(large_coeffs)
    shares = large_values[1:]
    return shares
```

```python
def packed_reconstruct(shares):
    large_values = [0] + shares
    large_coeffs = fft3_backward(large_values)
    small_coeffs = large_coeffs[:ORDER2]
    small_values = fft2_forward(small_coeffs)
    secrets = small_values[1:K+1]
    return secrets
```

# Parameter Generation

```python
def generate_parameters(min_bitsize, k, t, n):
    order2 = k + t + 1
    order3 = n + 1
    
    order_divisor = order2 * order3
    p, g = find_prime_field(min_bitsize, order_divisor)
    
    order = p - 1
    omega2 = pow(g, order // order2, p)
    omega3 = pow(g, order // order3, p)
    
    return p, omega2, omega3
```

```python
def find_prime_field(min_bitsize, order_divisor):
    p, order_prime_factors = find_prime(min_bitsize, order_divisor)
    g = find_generator(p, order_prime_factors)
    return p, g
```

```python
def find_generator(prime, order_prime_factors):
    order = prime - 1
    for candidate in range(2, Q):
        for factor in order_prime_factors:
            exponent = order // factor
            if pow(candidate, exponent, Q) == 1:
                break
        else:
            return candidate
```

## Finding primes

```python
def find_prime(min_bitsize, order_divisor):
    while True:
        k1 = sample_prime(min_bitsize)
        for k2 in range(128):
            p = k1 * k2 * order_divisor + 1
            if is_prime(p):
                order_prime_factors  = [k1]
                order_prime_factors += prime_factor(k2)
                order_prime_factors += prime_factor(order_divisor)
                return p, order_prime_factors
```

```python
def sample_prime(bitsize):
    lower = 1 << (bitsize-1)
    upper = 1 << (bitsize)
    while True:
        candidate = random.randrange(lower, upper)
        if is_prime(candidate):
            return candidate
```

```python
def prime_factor(x):
    factors = []
    for prime in SMALL_PRIMES:
        if prime > x: break
        if x % prime == 0:
            factors.append(prime)
            x = remove_factor(x, prime)
    assert(x == 1)
    return factors
```
